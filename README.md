## About The Project
In everyday life, we often experience that the food we have ordered or made does not meet our expectations,
whether it is the taste of the food, the price of the food, or the nutritional information of the food. From this problem,
we had the idea to create a food menu recipe recommendation application that recognizes user characteristics, called DishDelight.

DishDelight is designed to help users with regards to serving food, such as how to make food that is cheap but delicious,
how to make food that doesn't take a long time, how to make food for certain programs such as the diet,
diabetes program and so on and in making this application it has been packaged using an intelligent algorithm so that food recommendations can be in accordance with user preferences.
This application also provides detailed information about nutrition regarding food recipes in the application,
so that it can help users decide what menu they want to cook. Our goal in creating this application is to help improve the quality of life starting from consuming nutritious and balanced food intake,
because if we don't care about the food we consume, it can certainly affect our potential and abilities.
